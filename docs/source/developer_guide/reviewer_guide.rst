Reviewer Guide
==============

Pull Request reviewers play an important role in ``skpro``'s development.

.. warning::

    The reviewer guide is under development. If you have suggestions, open an
    issue or Pull Request.


Triage
======

* Assign relevant labels
* Assign to relevant project board
* Title: Is it using the 3-letter codes? Is it understandable?
* Description: Is it understandable? Any related issues/PRs?
* CI checks: approval for first-time contributors, any help needed with
  code/doc quality checks?
* Merge conflicts

Code Review
===========

* Unit testing:

    - Are the code changes tested?
    - Are the tests understandable?
    - Are all changes covered by tests? We usually aim for a test coverage of
      at least 90%.
    - Code coverage will be reported as part of the automated CI checks on GitHub

* Test changes locally: Does everything work as expected?
* Deprecation warnings:

    - Has the public API changed?
    - Have deprecation warnings been added before making the changes?

.. _reviewer_guide_doc:

Documentation Review
====================

* Are the docstrings complete and understandable to users?
* Do they follow the NumPy format and ``skbase`` conventions?
* If the same parameter, attribute, return object or error is included elsewhere
  in ``skpro`` are the docstring descriptions as similar as possible?
* Does the online documentation render correctly with the changes?
* Do the docstrings contain links to the relevant topics in the
  :ref:`glossary` or :ref:`user_guide`?

.. note::

    If a Pull Request does not meet ``skpro``'s
    :ref:`documentation guide <developer_guide_documentation>` a reviewer should
    require the documentation be updated prior to approving the Pull Request.
