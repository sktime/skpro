Code of conduct
===============

The ``skpro`` project believes that everyone should be able to participate
in our community without fear of harassment or discrimination. All contributors
are expected to show respect and courtesy to other members of the community
at all times.

As an offshoot of the sktime project, we ask all members of the community to conform
to the sktime project's
`Code of Conduct <https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/get_involved/code_of_conduct.html>`_.

If you need to report a Code of Conduct incident, reach out
to Dr. Franz Kir√°ly by email at franz.kiraly@sktime.net.

.. note::

    ``skpro`` is currently maintained by the ``sktime`` community, and subject to its
    Code of Conduct processes (including how to report incidents).
    This may change as the project matures.
    However, ``skpro``'s Code of Conduct will remain
    dedicated to promoting a community without harassment and discrimination.
