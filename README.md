A supervised domain-agnostic framework that allows for probabilistic modelling, namely the prediction of probability distributions for individual data points.

The package offers a variety of features and specifically allows for

- the implementation of probabilistic prediction strategies in the supervised contexts
- comparison of frequentist and Bayesian prediction methods
- strategy optimization through hyperparamter tuning and ensemble methods (e.g. bagging)
- workflow automation
